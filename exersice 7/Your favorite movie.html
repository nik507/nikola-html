    <h2>Iron Man</h2>
    <p><strong>Storyline</strong><br><br>
        Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark.<br> 
        When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, <br> 
        he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants.<br> 
        He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart.<br> 
        In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else.<br> 
        Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit.<br> 
        But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.
